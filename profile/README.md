## SustainAPI
**Developer**
SustainAPI aims to reduce the obstacles for developers building with a climate-centered mindset. We offer a collection of software services (through API) to help projects meet their net-zero carbon objectives. Our APIs enable micro-transactions to offset carbon and estimate emissions, which can be smoothly incorporated into your products and services.

**Climate Service Reducers**
SustainAPI provides the digital infrastructure for climate tech companies to offer their solutions via an API. We enable reducers to integrate and manage their tech through a dashboard that can be shared across the team. Our goal is to expand our network of climate services to facilitate desparately needed climate actions.

### Why
- Climate change is an urgent problem
- It’s hard: taking climate action is arduous. It takes time to source high quality climate projects and integrate them into operation. Likewise, climate tech sources lack the software infrastructure for digital transactions
- Growing solutions: lots of new startups building around climate-friendly products/services
- Regulations: governments are in talk to mandate corporate emission reporting. This enables corporations to identify and take climate actions on weak points
- Growing solutions: growing number of new startups building around climate-friendly products & services
- Growing market: voluntary offset market is expected grow with demand for carbon credits is expected to increase 15-fold to a $50 billion market by 2030
